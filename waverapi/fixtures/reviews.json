            "review": "It is an extremely expressive synth to play. The PolyBrute is laid out so logically that even though I've only had it for a month, I can already use it in the dark without needing to read the labels on the knobs or sliders. The possibilities on the mod-matrix are vast, but actually making it happen is really easy.",

            "review": "The DSI Prophet 6 is probably the most compelling Analog Polyphonic Synthesizer on the market at the moment. Having learned synthesis on a Moog Modular in the 70's it is clear to me that this little beast is the real deal. A modern Analog Poly Synth wrapped in a very modern feature set. If you're looking for the classic Prophet 5 sound but did not want to deal with the unstable tuning headaches of the original then your ship just came in.",
